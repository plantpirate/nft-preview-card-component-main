### What I learned

How to use image overlay effects, and will need to keep learning how to use if the design comes up again. 

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - Very useful in explaining different ways to use image overlay effects, plus giving the code for certain effects and further explaining the functions.
